### ScriBt should not be present in the Source Code Directory

User is advised to use the Feature <b>ScriBtofy</b> (under <b>Tools</b> Menu) which adds ScriBt to PATH, so that it can be run under any directory. This ensures that compilation errors are not caused by any file of ScriBt.

<b>A notification would be provided to the user unless and until ScriBt is used from PATH, under a different directory</b>
