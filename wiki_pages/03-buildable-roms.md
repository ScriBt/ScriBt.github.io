title: Buildable ROMs
---

**ScriBt supports a particular ROM by the usability of Pre-Build. So far, these are the ROMs that ScriBt can support, Post KitKat. Nothing else special for Supporting a ROM.**

**A Note on CopperheadOS** : This ROM does not require the use of **Pre-Build** since it syncs the buildable devices' repos and their dependencies too. You can directly start building it after getting the source synced.
  
**More ROMs will be added**
