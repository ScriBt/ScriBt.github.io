**Projekt ScriBt** is an attempt to Automate Android ROM building from Source, by a series of **prompts**, which performs the task while **explaining the same**, so that the user could **try it by himself/herself** manually.<br>

It helps the user in performing the Procedure required to build an Android ROM from Source.<br>

This tool is intended for **One-Time use** (or until the user understands the concepts), after which the user is suggested to try compiling the ROM from source, by themselves.<br>

**Guides for building a ROM are available in the Internet** (I've learned from there too :D). However, if the user wishes to **learn the concepts** as well as its **application in respective commands**, then this tool can get it done.<br>

Optionally, it can also be used to **automate the entire process** with the help of a **Configuration file** containing Device Information (Sources' Info)

Started on 07th May, 2016 and Publicly Released on 19th November, 2016 on **<a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/chef-central/android/guide-tool-projekt-scribt-v1-33-t3503018" target="_blank">XDA-Developers</a>**<br><br>
