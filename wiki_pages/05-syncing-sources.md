# Options available for `repo sync`

### Number of Threads (`-j#`)

No. of threads to be used for Syncing sources. If you have a weak Internet Connection OR you want to take a look at the Output, set the Number of Jobs to 1, else set it according to your wish (No of threads <= No of CPU cores - Recommended)

### Silent Sync (`-q`)

If Enabled, Sync output won't be shown. But, file-checkout progress is shown irrespective of it.

### Sync current Branch (`-c`)

If Enabled, It syncs only the branch which is specified in the manifest. A Data/Bandwidth Saving Attempt.

### Clone Depth (`--depth="#"`)

If Depth Value is set, It'd Sync the Repository with a limited amount of Commit History (dependent on Depth Value). Another B/W saving attempt, but it is recommended not to use this flag if you don't know the effects.

### Force Syncing (`--force-sync`)

If Enabled, Local Sources having changes would be overwritten by Remote, thus ensuring a cleaner attempt for Building the ROM.
