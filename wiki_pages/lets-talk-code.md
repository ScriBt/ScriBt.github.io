## Advice : Developers ONLY!

**WikiPage which describes each file in the source tree.**  

**ROM.sh** is the heart of ScriBt.  

`ScriBt="ROM.sh";`

Files in **src/** are **Not Code** - but are Informational Modules, which are required by ScriBt to execute any module.  

`ROM_NAME` is the full name of a ROM, which is shown to the user.  

`ROMNIS` - **ROM** **N**ame **I**n **S**ource - eg. `cm`, `lineage`, `aosp`, `full`, etc.

## `src` - Directory Structure
